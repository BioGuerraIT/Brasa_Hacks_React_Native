# Hackathon - Brasa Hacks 2022: our solution (front-end)

## About the solution
We've develop an universal authentication system that uses the Blockchain to create the digital identification of each user. 

Here, the user will have total control of their data and who can access them. Some information is public on the Blockchain, but others can be protected by encryption (only the data owner can read them).

The front-end application was developed using React Native with the support of Web 3.0 libraries, integrating our system with the blockchain!
